# odin-etch-a-sketch

This project showcases my DOM manipulation skills, based on the skills I have learned with the help of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It represents a drawind pad, where the user can "draw" on the screen by hovering the mouse pointer over the drawing area. The size of the drawing area is established by the user before starting to draw.
